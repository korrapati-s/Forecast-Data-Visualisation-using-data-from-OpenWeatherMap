# Forecast-Data-Visualisation-using-data-from-OpenWeatherMap

In this application we can visualize the forecast data retrieved from OpenWeatherMap using an API. The call to the API can be found at /js/owm.js. From here we can access weather data for the nest 5 days

This application is built using Express at the backend and Bootstrap and HTML on the UI part. The platform used to build this is Node.JS

The library used for the visualisation is HighCharts

We can even Insert and Delete data as in the previous assignment.
